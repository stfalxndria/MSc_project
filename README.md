Descriptors and Machine Learning for Lithium Titanium Sulfide (LTS).

The main purpose of this github page is to store and provide the data and calculations that were completed on the HPC, to recreate the work that we had done. This includes the input and ouput CRYSTAL files for the higher symmetry structures and the MBTR parameter checker/

Will be using DScribe descriptors: Coulomb Matrix, Sine Matrix, Ewald Sum, Smooth overlap of Atomic Positions, Many Body Tensor Representation. We have also written our own Coulomb Matrix to ensure permutation invariance.

Will be also using Sklearn packages to perform machine learning calculations: Linear Regression, KMeans Clustering, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and K Neighbors Regression. Neural Network was built using Tensorflow and Keras.
