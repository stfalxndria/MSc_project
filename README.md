# MSc_project
Descriptors and Machine Learning for Lithium Titanium Sulfide (LTS).

Will be using DScribe descriptors: Coulomb Matrix, Sine Matrix, Ewald Sum, Smooth overlap of Atomic Positions, Many Body Tensor Representation.

Will be also using Sklearn packages to perform machine learning calculations: Linear Regression, KMeans Clustering, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and K Neighbors Regression.
